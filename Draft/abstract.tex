\label{sec:abstract}
Researchers and practitioners have proposed and evaluated many practices for measuring and improving software security during software development. However, attackers find vulnerabilities even in very carefully written software. Assessing security outcomes for software requires measuring both the effectiveness of security practices in software development and the vulnerability risk for hte released software; we might ask whether `secure' software is secure because of the care taken in its construction, or because it is lucky in its enemies. \textit{The goal of this research is to support researchers and practitioners in measuring the effect of security practice use on software vulnerabilities by building and validating an explanatory model for software development security practice use.} In this work, we specify a model hypothesizing relationships between security criticality, security practice adherence, and security outcomes.  We evaluate the model quantitatively, via a dataset of security-critical projects, and qualitatively, via case studies of two open source projects, OpenSSL and phpMyAdmin. In our data, security outcomes were influenced by both the context of the software and the influence of security practice use. The strongest relationships between security practice use and favorable security outcomes were associated with team use of vulnerability tracking, security review, and secure coding standards.
