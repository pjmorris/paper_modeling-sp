Context: Researchers and practitioners have proposed and evaluated metrics for measuring software and software development process characteristics and their impact on software security. However, assessing software security requires measuring not only software and development process characteristics, but also the context in which the software is used. 

Goal:  \textit{The goal of this research is to support researchers and practitioners in measuring the effect of software and environmental context factors and security practice adherence on software security outcomes by building and evaluating an explanatory model using structural equation modeling.} 

Method: We develop a model hypothesizing relationships between software context factors (Software Risk), software usage factors (Asset Impact), adherence to security practices (Adherence), and security outcomes (Outcomes).  We evaluated the model and our hypotheses quantitatively, applying Structural Equation Modeling (SEM) to two existing datasets: 6695 projects sampled from the National Vulnerability Database (NVD); and 428 projects from the Core Infrastructure Initiative (CII) census dataset.  

Results: As measured in our data from both case studies, Software Risk, Asset Impact, and Adherence each have statistically significant effects on Outcomes. The CII case study results agreed with previous research suggesting that team size and code size (factors underlying Software Risk) are correlated with higher vulnerability counts (a measure of Outcomes). In both studies, network exposure (a factor of Software Risk) is correlated with higher vulnerability counts (a measure of Outcomes).

Conclusion: The model and results from the two case studies offer a guide to available metrics for prioritizing management of Software Risk, Asset Impact, Adherence measures, and security Outcomes. SEM offers a means for assessing model fit and iteratively refining the model to more accurately model what influences security outcomes.
