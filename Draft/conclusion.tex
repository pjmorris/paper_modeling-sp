\section{Conclusion}
\label{sec:conclusion}

In this paper, we have presented a model of factors affecting software security, with empirical tests of the model using two datasets. Our results indicate that:
\begin{itemize}
	\item
\end{itemize} 	
These findings correlate with previous findings by X, Y, and Z.

Our data suggest that not only software attributes, but the context of software use must be accounted for to assess the state of software security. Researchers and practitioners should measure both software attributes and software usage context when assessing software development practice adherence. That said, our analysis shows correlation, but not causation. Further work including manipulation of variables must be conducted to assess the causes of software insecurity and security.
