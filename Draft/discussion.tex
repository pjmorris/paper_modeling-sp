\begin{itemize}
	\item The NVD data offers per-manufacturer, per-project overview of reporter interest in software vulnerabilities, evidence that per-vulnerability severity is decreasing, and confirmation that the network is an important attack vector.
	\item The CII data offers evidence that SLOC and team size are correlated with manifest vulnerabilities. 
	\item Combined NVD-CII data supports better model fit, and offers theoretical support for X, Y, Z elements of the SP-EF measurement model. 
	\item Stepping back from the specifics of the case studies, SEM offers means of assessing the relative importance of the measurements taken for software security assessement.
	\item Asset Value, Software Risk, Adherence, and Outcomes appear to be a reasonable place to start for organizing studies of the factors behind software security success and failure.
