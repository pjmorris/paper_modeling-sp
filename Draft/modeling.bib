	abstract = {In this work we examine the feasibility of quantitatively characterizing some aspects of security. In particular, we investigate if it is possible to predict the number of vulnerabilities that can potentially be present in a software system but may not have been found yet. We use several major operating systems as representatives of complex software systems. The data on vulnerabilities discovered in these systems are analyzed. We examine the results to determine if the density of vulnerabilities in a program is a useful measure. We also address the question about what fraction of software defects are security related, i.e., are vulnerabilities. We examine the dynamics of vulnerability discovery hypothesizing that it may lead us to an estimate of the magnitude of the undiscovered vulnerabilities still present in the system. We consider the vulnerability discovery rate to see if models can be developed to project future trends. Finally, we use the data for both commercial and open-source systems to determine whether the key observations are generally applicable. Our results indicate that the values of vulnerability densities fall within a range of values, just like the commonly used measure of defect density for general defects. Our examination also reveals that it is possible to model the vulnerability discovery using a logistic model that can sometimes be approximated by a linear model.},

	doi = {10.1109/32.799939},
	abstract = {Experimentation in software engineering is necessary but difficult. One reason is that there are a large number of context variables and, so, creating a cohesive understanding of experimental results requires a mechanism for motivating studies and integrating results. It requires a community of researchers that can replicate studies, vary context variables, and build models that represent the common observations about the discipline. The paper discusses the experience of the authors, based upon a collection of experiments, in terms of a framework for organizing sets of related studies. With such a framework, experiments can be viewed as part of common families of studies, rather than being isolated events. Common families of studies can contribute to important and relevant hypotheses that may not be suggested by individual experiments. A framework also facilitates building knowledge in an incremental manner through the replication of experiments within families of studies. To support the framework, the paper discusses the experiences of the authors in carrying out empirical studies, with specific emphasis on persistent problems encountered in experimental design, threats to validity, criteria for evaluation, and execution of experiments in the domain of software engineering},

@inproceedings{clelandhuang2006detection,
	abstract = {This paper introduces an information retrieval based approach for automating the detection and classification of non-functional requirements (NFRs). Early detection of NFRs is useful because it enables system level constraints to be considered and incorporated into early architectural designs as opposed to being refactored in at a later time. Candidate NFRs can be detected in both structured and unstructured documents, including requirements specifications that contain scattered and non-categorized NFRs, and freeform documents such as meeting minutes, interview notes, and memos containing stakeholder comments documenting their NFR related needs. This paper describes the classification algorithm and then evaluates its effectiveness in an experiment based on fifteen requirements specifications developed as term projects by MS students at DePaul University. An additional case study is also described in which the approach is used to classifying NFRs from a large free form requirements document obtained from Siemens Logistics and Automotive Organization},

However, the low level of acceptance and use of software measures in practice has been a constant concern. In this paper we propose and test a model which explains and predicts the use of software measures. The model is based on the technology acceptance model ({TAM}) and operationalizes the perceived usefulness construct according to the “desirable properties of software measures.” Our research provides guidance for software engineers in selecting among different software measures and for software metrics coordinators who are planning measurement programs.},
